# Introductory-Python-Course-
An absolute-beginner Python course based on Dr. Charles Severance's Python for Everybody textbook and his Coursera course of the same name.

The course is designed to be 30-hours long - 10 sessions of 3 hours each, covering all the fundamental programming ideas. Lab sessions make use of both the the Python (3.6.4) interpreter as well as scripts (the text editor used is Atom). Each session contains brief and succint descriptions of the key ideas under the chapter, along with worked examples and exercises for the student. Review questions are provided at the end of the session to facilitate further understanding.

The format of the course would best work in a university setting (one semester course) or a large class. Just provide a hard copy of the instruction sheet for the student and let him/her work through it, providing additional input where necessary. Additionally, there are MCQ quizzes as well as assignments designed to aid continuous assessment.

This is a course that I am currently teaching at the South Eastern University of Sri Lanka. I will be uploading new chapters on a weekly basis, under different branches till the course is over - at which time all branches will be merged together.
